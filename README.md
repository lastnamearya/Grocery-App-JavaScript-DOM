# Groceries Shopping List App
I made this app in order to learn DOM Manipulation in plain vanilla.js. I made this app from scratch to strengthen my DOM Manipulation Skills.
This App brings together a selection of the DOM techniques to update the contents of the List. It has three main aims:

## 1. Add a New Item to the Start and End of the List
Adding an item to the start of the list requires the use of a different method than adding an element to the end of list.

## 2. Set a Class Attribute on all Items
This involves looping through each of the '<li>' elements i.e my Shopping List Items and updating the value of the class attribute to 'cool'.

## 3. Add the number of list items to the heading
This involves four Steps

1. Reading the content of the heading.
2. Counting the number of elements in the page.
3. Adding the number of items to the content of the heading.
4. Updating the heading with this new Content.
